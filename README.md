- 👋 Hi, I’m just experimenting with git, exploring coding and modern programming concepts while I dabble day to day.
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics projects but have yet to make time for much of it. Learning linux (scripting and programming).
- 🌱 I’m linux, c,c++,c#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (Nothing right now, I'd be more of a burden than an asset)
- 📫 I can be reached on (to be decided)
